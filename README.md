XWMM
====

XBMC Web Media Manager

Zernable created an "unofficial" version of XWMM for Frodo. Most of the functionality of the Eden version is working including editing of movie, TV and music metadata.

Features not yet working Todo list:

[] -Changing artwork

[] -Managing movie sets, genres and actors (although these can be changed on a per movie/TV/music basis)

[] -The "Files" tab


I have tested these changes under Firefox, Chrome and Opera and all features are functional. I have no way of testing Internet Explorer or Safari.

This updated version is not available in the repo, but the zip file can be downloaded from the following link and then installed via the "install addon from zip file" from repo

Please test out and post any issues you run into. I will be providing all my changes back to Slash for him to incorporate into the next official release if he chooses.

Enjoy!
