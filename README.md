### SUBMITTING PATCHES AND PR's
The idea is to fork MASTER, work on your changes and make a pull request (PR) to XVMM Master Repo, it should contain some of the following:

* What Patch addresses, if its a bug-fix a feature or improvement or something else.
* Any comments in code for what is not immediately obvious.

## Note:
A pull request PR should be made against MASTER, by using Master then your working with latest code and fixes.
Any work can then be easily cherry-picked and pulled into branches if needed, especially if its a bug-fix.

#### What will happen to Patches & PR's

* It will be reviewed and merged as soon as possible by someone who understands what's going on.
