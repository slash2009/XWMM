### SUBMITTING PATCHES AND PR's
The idea is to fork this repo work on your changes and make a pull request (PR) to XVMM Master Repo, it should contain some of the following:

* What Patch addresses, if its a bug-fix a feature or improvement or something else.
* Any comments in code for what is not immediately obvious.
 
## Note:
A pull request PR should be made to MASTER, (using Branches is ok if your going to make same PR to master) by using Master then your working with latest code and fixes.
Any work can then be easily Picked and pulled into branches if needed, especially if its a bug-fix.
#### What will happen to Patches & PR's

* It will be reviewed and merged as soon as possible by someone who understands what's going on.
